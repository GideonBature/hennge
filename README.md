# Mission Description
#
We want you to calculate a sum of squares of given integers, excluding any negatives.

* The first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 100)
* Each of the test cases will consists of a line with an integer X (0 < X <= 100), followed by another line consisting of X number of space-seperated integers Yn (-100 <= Yn <= 100).
* For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers excluding any negatives, and print the calculated sum in the output.

* Note 1: There should be no output until all the input has been received.
* Note 2: Do not put blank lines between test cases solutions.
* Note 3: Take input from standard input, and output to standard output.
 
## Rules

* Choose your favorite language from either of these two: Go, Python
* Do not use any for loop, while loop, or any list/set/dictionary comprehension
* Your solution will be tested against Python 3.12 (as of April 2024) or higher

* ``` def main():
   ...
```
```
* if name === "main":
       main()
```
